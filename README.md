# Refresher Landing Page 🚀

A responsive, modern landing page built with HTML, SCSS, and GSAP animations — created as part of my 2025 front-end refresher journey.

This project helped me rebuild my development workflow from scratch, using clean, modular code and visual design principles that reflect the standards I aim to bring into future freelance and agency work.
